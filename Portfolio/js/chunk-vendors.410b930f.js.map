Since a regular \"click\" event will most likely be generated anyway (one that has its isTrusted flag set to true), we must slightly delay our script-generated click so that the \"real\"/trusted one is prioritized. Remember, when there are duplicate events in quick succession, we suppress all but the first one. Some browsers don't even trigger the \"real\" one at all, so our synthetic one is a safety valve that ensures that no matter what, a click event does get dispatched.\n            if (_getTime() - onClickTime > 300 && !e.defaultPrevented) {\n              if (e.target.click) {\n                //some browsers (like mobile Safari) don't properly trigger the click event\n                e.target.click();\n              } else if (ownerDoc.createEvent) {\n                var syntheticEvent = ownerDoc.createEvent(\"MouseEvents\");\n                syntheticEvent.initMouseEvent(\"click\", true, true, _win, 1, eventData.screenX, eventData.screenY, eventData.clientX, eventData.clientY, false, false, false, false, 0, null);\n                e.target.dispatchEvent(syntheticEvent);\n              }\n            }\n          });\n        }\n      }\n\n      self.isDragging = self.isGesturing = self.isPressed = false;\n      onStop && !isNormalizer && onStopDelayedCall.restart(true);\n      onDragEnd && wasDragging && onDragEnd(self);\n      onRelease && onRelease(self, wasDragging);\n    },\n        _onGestureStart = function _onGestureStart(e) {\n      return e.touches && e.touches.length > 1 && (self.isGesturing = true) && onGestureStart(e, self.isDragging);\n    },\n        _onGestureEnd = function _onGestureEnd() {\n      return (self.isGesturing = false) || onGestureEnd(self);\n    },\n        onScroll = function onScroll(e) {\n      if (_ignoreCheck(e)) {\n        return;\n      }\n\n      var x = scrollFuncX(),\n          y = scrollFuncY();\n      onDelta((x - scrollX) * scrollSpeed, (y - scrollY) * scrollSpeed, 1);\n      scrollX = x;\n      scrollY = y;\n      onStop && onStopDelayedCall.restart(true);\n    },\n        _onWheel = function _onWheel(e) {\n      if (_ignoreCheck(e)) {\n        return;\n      }\n\n      e = _getEvent(e, preventDefault);\n      onWheel && (wheeled = true);\n      var multiplier = (e.deltaMode === 1 ?
